CustomCountdownTimer
====================

A java timer that notifies you at custom intervals and remembers your last used settings.

This is still under development. For the moment the application will start, with the menu options and an unfinished UI which is not responsive. To close the application, use the x button on the top right corner of the window or use the exit menu item in the file menu.
