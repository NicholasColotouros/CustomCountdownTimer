CustomCountdownTimer
====================

A java timer that notifies you at custom intervals and remembers your last used settings.

This is still under development. For the moment the application will run a hardcoded timer as the user interface is still in the process of being created. To close the application, use the x button on the top right corner of the window or use the exit menu item in the file menu.

Features left to implement:
---------------------------
* User input from GUI
* Main Window aesthetics/nicer look
* Saving/loading
* Main window aesthetics

Possible features to be added down the road:
* Settings, such as:
    * Different alert sounds
    * Option of audio and/or visual alerts
    * Different languages
